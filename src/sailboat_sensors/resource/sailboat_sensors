We tried the following cable configurations to our laptop: RS232 -> M12 -> Laptop, RS232 -> M12 -> M12 -> USB -> Laptop. Neither of these allowed us to control the CANBus. 
When reading from serial output, we unreadable computer format from both the M12 -> laptop setup and the USB -> Laptop setup. Reading from serial directly also causes the estop to be triggered. We attempted to run the python-can library and write directly to the serial port however this would cause the amiga dashboard to automatically estop. This was the same behavior when we read from the canbus using the python-can library.
